# Prework - *amb app*

Submitted by: **Haiying Chen**

**amb app** is an app that is prework to IOS 101 for Codepath. The background color changes as you press the button: "Change".

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
**Discord**
1. Being able to communicate with others through several different ways: text, video call, and voice call
2. Being able to join different servers to make new friends
3. The ability to edit and remove your messages

**Notion**
1. Being able to make your own board to organize things
2. You can connect your Notion database (which has different display features) to Google Calendar so you can view your tasks there

**Notion Calendar**
1. You can connect Google Calendar to Notion Calendar, and also connect to your Notion database so you can have events AND tasks (from your database) shown at the same time
2. Very clean and organized interface/UI

I want to make an app that combines Notion, Notion Calendar, and Google Calendar. Although these applications are very convenient to use, there are certain features that makes it harder to use. I want a calendar app like Notion Calendar where I can connect to Notion databases but also be able to make tasks in the app itself instead of having to go into Notion and add tasks there. It's just not efficient. I also want to make the tasks show as to-do lists so I feel more accomplished when I check off boxes. I also want to add a "notes" section where I can list/write about things happening in that day or some things I want to do that aren't "tasks" to be exact.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was confused on step 3, connecting UI to logic as I was unable to locate the storyboard file.
